# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-15)

**Core value:** Produce fair, defensible scores alongside human judges -- while being entertaining and resistant to prompt injection from a security-savvy audience.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Capture Layer (COMPLETE)

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 6 (Capture Layer - COMPLETE)
Plan: 4 of 4 in current phase (COMPLETE)
Status: Phase 1 complete, ready for Phase 2
Last activity: 2026-02-15 -- Completed 01-04-PLAN.md with verified end-to-end testing

Progress: [████░░░░░░] 17%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 4
- Average duration: 4min
- Total execution time: 0.27 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-capture-layer | 4/4 | 16min | 4min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (4min), 01-02 (2min), 01-03 (3min), 01-04 (16min - includes verification)
- Trend: Stable with verification overhead

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Dual-LLM defense layer (Phase 2) must be built before commentary or scoring pipelines
- [Roadmap]: Phases 3 (Commentary) and 4 (Scoring) can execute in parallel after Phase 2
- [Roadmap]: TTS emotional variety and failover deferred to Phase 6 hardening
- [01-01]: Hand-rolled async event bus with asyncio.create_task instead of asyncio-signal-bus library
- [01-01]: Synchronous state machine callbacks publish to async event bus via create_task dispatch
- [01-01]: Module-level default_bus singleton for shared bus across components
- [01-02]: KeyFrameDetector uses cv2.HISTCMP_CORREL with threshold 0.4 for scene change detection
- [01-02]: Camera _capture_and_encode is synchronous, called via asyncio.to_thread for non-blocking capture
- [01-02]: Audio mute discards data but keeps reading the stream to prevent buffer overflow
- [01-03]: Used regular except (not except*) in GeminiSession.run() reconnection loop -- Python disallows break in except* blocks
- [01-03]: OperatorCLI uses asyncio.to_thread(input, ...) for non-blocking stdin reads
- [01-03]: State-aware hints on invalid transitions guide operator to correct command sequence
- [01-04]: Pipeline is thin glue with no business logic -- only component wiring and lifecycle management
- [01-04]: Capture tasks created on demo_started, cancelled on demo_stopped via event bus subscriptions
- [01-04]: Gemini observations stored in demo session on stop for downstream scoring
- [01-04]: Use native audio model (gemini-2.0-flash-exp) with output transcription for text-based observations

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Gemini Live API 2-minute session limit needs validation with context window compression (research gap)
- NEBULA:FOG official rubric details needed for Phase 4 scoring calibration
